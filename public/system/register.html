 <h3>Rules</h3>
 <p>There are four rules to ensure Tag Me In remains a place that supports positive growth in the collective human
  consciousness. The rules are (1) No Free Speech (2) No Animal Exploitation (3) No Blasphemy (4) Stay On Topic.</p>
 <p>Content that is in violation of these rules will be deleted, and the author of the content will be warned.
  Repeated violations of these rules will result in a permanent ban. Explanations of each rule follow.</p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <h6>No Free Speech</h6>
   <p>Tag Me In is a privately-owned platform for positive world-change, and as such restricts freedom of speech. The
    following types of content (text / images / videos / links) are not permitted on Tag Me In:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Content that is illegal in your jurisdiction.</li>
    <li>Depictions or descriptions of harmful or violent actions.</li>
    <li>Speech that speaks negatively of an individual or a group. Instead, focus on positive things to strive for.</li>
    <li>Speaking positively or neutrally about any harmful action, harm is defined as causing a human or animal cell to
     lose function or to become diseased. Instead, promote beneficial actions.</li>
    <li>Offensive or foul language, use of curse/swear words in any language, incoherent rambling. Instead, be kind,
     clear and specific when writing.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   <h6>No Animal Exploitation</h6>
   <p>Content (text / images / videos / links) referencing meat, dairy, eggs, or other animal products obtained without
    consent from animals is expressly prohibited on Tag Me In. Do not post descriptions, videos, links, or images of
    animals suffering due to factory farming or other causes, even with the intention to "raise awareness". Recipes or
    links to products may be posted only if they are fully vegan and contain no animal byproducts. There are two
    exceptions:
   <ul>
    <li>Things that animals leave behind that are no longer part of the animal, such as droppings or shedding a skin is
     allowed.</li>
    <li>Bones or pelts harvested from an already-deceased animal that was not intentionally killed by a human are
     allowed.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   <h6>No Blasphemy</h6>
   <p>There is only one All - the Universe that we find ourselves to be a part of. However you personally believe it was
    created or
    came to be, content that
    demeans, belittles, or otherwise discounts the power of the All is expressly prohibited. Tag Me In welcomes all
    spiritual walks and paths to the Infinite, and condescension or criticism of any spiritual path is not welcome here.
    Instead, Interfaith unity is the inclusive narrative that can unite all human spiritual paths as we progress toward
    a brighter future of mutual stewardship and understanding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <h6>Stay On Topic</h6>
   <p>Content (text / images / videos / links) should support human and animal well-being in the hope of a
    positively-transformed
    world. Generally, all content should be non-fiction, except where fiction can illustrate a point. Tag Me In is not a
    place to make a fictional world better, we are here for our home, planet Earth.</p>
